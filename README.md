Hello!

I made this game as a project for one of my classes.

HOW TO RUN:
1. Download zip file and extract it
2. Load `main.exe`

HOW TO PLAY:
1. [A] to move left
2. [D] to move right
3. Star boxes give you invincibility for two paddle hits.
4. Shroom boxes make the paddle bigger for two paddle hits.

Thanks for reading!

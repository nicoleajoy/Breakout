## Introduction

Hello! 

I made this game as a project for one of my classes.

## How to Run

1. Download zip file
2. Extract contents
3. Load `main.exe` located in `Breakout/main` subfolder

## How to Play

The goal (to win) is to hit all of the boxes. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, game over.
There are 6 rows and 10 columns. Boxes closest to the bottom are worth 1 point, while boxes at the top are worth 6 points.

1. [A] to move left
2. [D] to move right
3. Star boxes give you invincibility for two paddle hits.
4. Shroom boxes make the paddle bigger for two paddle hits.

## Introduction

Hello! I made this game as a project for one of my classes.

## How to Run

1. Download zip file
2. Extract `Breakout.zip`
3. Open `Breakout/main.pde` with Processing

## How to Play

The goal (to win) is to hit all of the boxes. If the ball touches the bottom of the screen, game over.
There are 6 rows and 10 columns. Boxes closest to the bottom are worth **ONE** point, while boxes at the top are worth **SIX** points.

1. [A] to move paddle to the left
2. [D] to move paddle to the right
3. Star boxes give you invincibility for THREE paddle hits.
4. Shroom boxes make the paddle bigger for THREE paddle hits.
